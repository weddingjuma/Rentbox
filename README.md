## Topic of the project

The application can be used to manage rental portfolios.
Registered users can add rental units to their portfolios and leases to the rental units. 
Leases include the tenants name, monthly rent, the beginning and termination days of the lease and the amenities included (electricity, water, etc). 

A registered user can also list public information of all the rental units added to the application.

The application is written in PHP and uses PostgreSQL. The application is hosted at the Users server at the Department of Computer Science.
